A coupled cluster study of electron gas using blocks. 
The system consist of 294 states and 14 holes. These values are chosen to compare results with Audun Skau Hansen's master thesis.
The results are presented in the following order: 
weight, rs, Reference Energy, Iterations, time, CCD energy
0.3 1 13.6036 91 67.0702 -0.4984909094065708
