# Master
I repository for my Master thesis on Coupled Cluster theory

The folder contains following subfolders: 

ElectronGas:
	The program used to solve energy for the electron gas with block implementation. Contains folder with all results. 

Solver: 
	CCD Intermediates and CCD naive, made general, so pairing, electron gas and nuclear matter can use them. 

NuclearMatter:
	The program used to solve energy for nuclear matter with block implementation. 

Pairing_Model:
	The program used to solve energy for pairing model using fci and mbpt2,3,4

Report: 
	Folder containing all results

Sources: 
	A few pdf's saved for easy acces. 



The following folders are no longer needed 

ElectronGasBlockStructure:
	Original attempt at block solver. Code is more of a mess, and does not produce good results.

ParallellizationTesting:
	Made for educational purposes to learn OpenMP
