A coupled cluster study of electron gas comparing a parallel code with blocks implementation for different amount of states with the naive implementation with and without intermediates
The results are presented in the following order: 
Solver type, Shells, States, Occupied States, weight, rs, Reference Energy, Iterations, time, CCD Energy
