# Master
The repository for Wilhelm Holmen's Master thesis on Coupled Cluster theory

The folder contains following subfolders: 

ElectronGas:
	The program used to solve energy for the electron gas with block implementation. Contains folder with all results. 

Solver: 
	CCD Intermediates and CCD naive, made general, so pairing, electron gas and nuclear matter can use them. 

NuclearMatter:
	The program used to solve energy for nuclear matter with block implementation. 

Pairing_Model:
	The program used to solve energy for pairing model using fci and mbpt2,3,4

Report: 
	Folder containing the tex file and pdf file
